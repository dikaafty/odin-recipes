  <h1>Granola Cups</h1>
  <p>These granola cups are a great grab-and-go breakfast option. You can tailor them to suit your own tastesâ€”flavor them with the spices you prefer, swap out almonds for another nut, and use any kind of yogurt or fruit that you enjoy. For best results, wait until just before serving to fill them with yogurt.</p>
