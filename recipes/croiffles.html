  <p>Popularized in South Korea, the croiffle (or croffle) is simply a croissant cooked in a waffle maker. The TikTok-famous treat is the latest addition to the croissant-variant family, next to cruffins, cronuts, and even these stuff-able croissant cones.</p>

  <h1>How to Make TikTok Croiffles</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat your waffle iron to medium-low heat, then spritz with cooking spray.</li>
    <li>On a lightly-floured surface, roll out the sheet of puff pastry dough with a rolling pin until you get a large rectangle with even thinness. Be careful not to incorporate too much flour. Using a knife or pizza cutter, cut out 8 long and thin triangles.</li>
    <li>Place 1-2 tablespoons of your desired filling on the wide end of the triangle and, starting on the wide end, roll the dough into a croissant shape.</li>
    <li>Move the rolled dough to the waffle iron, close the lid, and cook for 4-6 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
